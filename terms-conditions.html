    are located at <br>
    848 N. Rainbow Blvd. #5260<br>
Las Vegas, NV  89107<br> 
    </p>
    <p>By using the Website and Services, you agree to these Terms of Use (the "Terms"). You also
    consent to the collection and use of certain information about you, as specified in our privacy 
    policy (the "Privacy Policy"). Please read the Terms and Privacy Policy carefully. If you do 
    not understand the Terms or the Privacy Policy, please leave the Website and stop using the 
    Services.</p>
    <h4>CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
    <p>We may change the Terms or the Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new version of either
    on the Website. Please review the Terms and the Privacy Policy regularly. If at any time you find 
    either unacceptable, please leave the Website and stop using the Services.</p>
    <h4>ELIGIBILITY</h4>
    <p><strong>By using the Website or Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years
    old, a resident of the United States, and are otherwise legally qualified to enter into and 
    form contracts under applicable law.</strong>This Agreement is void where prohibited.</p>
    <h4>LICENSE</h4>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to make personal,
    non-commercial use of the Website and Services. Upon termination of this Agreement, this 
    license will automatically terminate.</p>
    <h4>SERVICES</h4>
    <p>a. <strong>We are not a lender and do not make loans or credit decisions in connection with 
    loans. Instead, we refer consumers seeking loans to lenders who may provide loans (the 
    "Services"). We may refer a consumer directly to a lender, or we may refer a consumer 
    to a third-party partner who then may refer the consumer to a lender. We may share 
    consumer application information with more than one lender and/or third-party partner. 
    We may submit your application to lenders and/or third-party partners multiple times over 
    a 24-hour period.</strong>Consumers who are not matched with a lender may be directed to a third-
    party website, which advertises third-party products and services (for additional information, see 
    the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below).</p>
    <p>b. <strong>We do not guarantee that we will match you with a lender, or that your Application will 
    be approved by a lender. Likewise, we do not guarantee the amount of funds that may be 
    extended to you if a lender approves your application.</strong>We will not necessarily match you 
    with the lender that provides the best rates and terms.</p>
    <p>c. We do not charge you fees for the Services. Instead, we receive fees from lenders and third-
    party partners for our referral services.</p>
    <p>d. We are not a party to any contract made between you and lenders for loans. All rights and 
    obligations under the terms of the contract for a loan are solely between you and the lender.<strong> We 
    do not warrant, endorse, guarantee or assume responsibility for any lender, or any product 
    or service offered by a lender.</strong> You should use your own judgment in deciding which available 
    loan product, terms or lender best suits your needs and financial means.</p>
    <p>e. In order to use the Services, you must complete and submit an application (the "Application"). 
    A completed Application includes your personal information, such as full name, address, 
    telephone number, email address, social security number, driver's license number, employer 
    information and banking information. <strong>By using the Services, you authorize us to transmit 
    your Application to one or more lenders and/or third-party partners. In addition, you 
    authorize our lenders and/or third-party partners to verify your Application information, 
    including by performing a credit check.</strong> Lenders and/or third-party partners to whom we 
    have provided your Application information as part of the Services may store your Application 
    information indefinitely, whether or not you are qualified for a loan or if you make a loan. <strong>We 
    do not have control over your Application information stored by our lenders and/or third-
    party partners, and therefore we assume no liability or responsibility for any unauthorized 
    access to, or use of, your Application information stored by our lenders and third-party 
    partners.</strong></p>
    <h4>YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
    <p><strong>You represent and warrant that all information that you provide on an Application or
    otherwise in connection with your use of the Website and Services will be current, complete 
    and truthful.</strong></p>

    consent to receive marketing emails from us and our third-party marketing partners on 
    our behalf.</strong> You may opt-out of receiving emails marketing our products and services at any 
    time by following the opt-out instructions contained in the emails.</p>
    <p>b. <strong>By using the Services, you consent to receive administrative and marketing emails from 
    the lenders and third-party partners to whom we have provided your information as part 
    of the Services, whether or not you are qualified for a loan or if you make a loan.</strong> You may 
    opt-out of receiving marketing emails from these parties by following the opt-out instructions 
    contained in their respective emails.</p>
    <h4>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h4>
    <p>The Website links to, and may direct you to, third-party websites ("Third-Party Websites").

    <h4>PROHIBITED USES</h4>
    <p>We impose certain restrictions on your use of the Website and the Services. You shall not:</p>

    means, including but not limited to, through manual applications, the use of robots or other

    exists or will exist in the future, for any purpose; </p>
    <p>d. provide false, misleading or inaccurate information on an Application or otherwise in

    and organization thereof, are the intellectual property of Standard Auto Financial or its 
    licensors. Neither your use of the Website and Services, nor your entry into this Agreement, 
    grant you any right, title or interest in or to any such content or materials. STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
    , AutoFinancialCare.host and the "STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL"

    <h4>DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h4>
    <h4>a. NO WARRANTIES</h4>
    <p><strong>The Website and Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Use 
    of the Website and Services are at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted 
    by applicable law, the Website and Services are provided without warranties of any 
    kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of 
    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or 
    information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the Website 
    or Services will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. Without limiting the 
    foregoing, we and our licensors (and our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, 
    directors, and employees) do not warrant that the Website and Services are accurate, 
    reliable or correct; that the Website and Services will meet your requirements; that the 
    Website and Services will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or 
    secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Website and Services are 
    free of viruses or other harmful components. </strong></p>
    <h4>b. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h4>
    <p>i. <strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will we and our 
    licensors (and our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, directors, and employees) be 
    liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary 
    damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or 
    other intangible losses, that result from the use of, inability to use, or unavailability of the 
    Website or Services.</strong></p>
    <p>ii.<strong> In no event will we and our licensors (and our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, 
    agents, directors, and employees) be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, 
    obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding $15,000. </strong></p>
    <p>iii.<strong> This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on 
    contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of 
    the possibility of such damage. </strong></p>
    <h4>DISPUTES</h4>
    <p>a. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Kansas, and 
    all claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in 
    contract, tort or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of Kansas. </p>
    <p>b. <strong>Any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Auto Financial Care, 
    any entity calling as or on behalf of Auto Financial Care, including 
    <a href="javascript:void(0)"/popups/lenders.html', 'view', 'width=400, height=500, top=10, left=10 ,scrollbars=yes')">marketplace partners</a>, 
    rising out of or relating in any way to the Website, Services or this Agreement will be resolved 
    by binding arbitration, rather than in court,</strong> except that either of us may assert qualifying claims 
    in small claims court. This agreement to arbitrate will be governed by and interpreted under 
    the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. </p>
    <p>c. Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which a neutral third person (an 
    arbitrator) decides a dispute. <strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and arbitration 
    awards are final and binding and subject to review by a court only on a very limited basis.
    However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a
    court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow 
    this Agreement as a court would. </strong>Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce 
    the arbitrator's award. You may, but are not required to, have a lawyer represent you during an 
    arbitration proceeding.</p>
    <p>d. To begin an arbitration proceeding, either party must send a letter to the other party requesting
    arbitration and describing the claim. We will send you notice of arbitration to the address that
    you provide as part of an Application. You must send us notice of arbitration to <br>
    General Counsel,<br> 
    Standard Auto Financial,<br>
    848 N. Rainbow Blvd. #5260<br>
Las Vegas, NV  89107<br>
    </p>
    <p>e. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will conduct the arbitration under its rules, 
    including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's 
    rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The AAA's rules will 
    govern the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees. We will reimburse those 
    fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are 
    frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator 
    determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by 
    telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in either the county where you live or 
    Johnson County, Kansas.</p>
    <p>f. <strong>Any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not
    in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court 
    rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.</strong></p>
    <p>g. <strong>To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of
    or relating to the Website, Services or this Agreement must be filed within one year. The 
    one-year period begins on the date that the claim or dispute first could be filed. Any claim 
    or dispute not filed within that time is permanently barred. This section applies to each of 
    our respective successors and assigns.</strong></p>
    <p>h. Any claims seeking to enforce, protect or determine the validity or ownership of any
    intellectual property rights are not subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, these claims, 
    including claims for injunctive or equitable relief, will be exclusively decided by courts of 
    competent jurisdiction in Johnson County, Kansas.</p>

    <h4>OTHER TERMS</h4>
    <p>a. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter of 
    this Agreement and supersedes all other oral or written agreements or policies relating thereto.</p>
    <p>b. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this
    Agreement, or application of that provision to any persons or circumstances other than those 
    as to which it is held unenforceable, will not be affected by that unenforceability and will be 
    enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
    <p>c. No waiver of satisfaction of a condition or nonperformance of an obligation under this
    Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party granting the
    waiver, and no such waiver will constitute a waiver of satisfaction of any other condition or 
    nonperformance of any other obligation.</p>
    <p>d. This Agreement is freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of
    assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</p>
