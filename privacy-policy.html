    <h4>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>This policy covers how STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL treats personal information
    that STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL collects and receives through this web site.
    Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your
    name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly
    available.</p>
    <p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
    does not own or control, or to people that STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
    does not employ or manage, or to information collected other than by 
    means of this web site.</p>
    </ul>
    <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
    <h4>General</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL collects personal information when you register with
    STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL, when you use STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL 
    products or services, when you visit STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL pages or the 
    pages of certain STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL partners. STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
     may combine information about you that we have with information we 
    obtain from business partners or other companies. </li>
    <li>When you register, we ask for information such as your name, email address, company 
    name and address. Once you register with STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL and sign in 
    to our services, or provide your information so that we can provide services to you, you 
    are not anonymous to us. </li>
    <li>STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL collects information about your transactions with us 
    and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of products 
    and services that we offer.</li>
    <li>STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL automatically receives and records information on 
    our server logs from your browser, including your IP-address, STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
     cookie information, and the page you request. </li>
    <li>STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL uses information for the following general purposes: 
    to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve 
    our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal 
    and external clients.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL does not rent, sell, or share personal information
    about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or 
    services you may be interested in, when we have your permission, or under the following 
    circumstances:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with
            STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL under confidentiality agreements. These 
            companies may use your personal information to help STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
             communicate with you about offers from STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
              and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have 
            any independent right to share this information. </li>
            <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or 
            exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. </li>
            <li>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, 
            or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving 
            potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL's 
            terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. </li>
            <li>We transfer information about you if STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL is 
            acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL
             will notify you before information about you is transferred and 
            becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </li>
            <li>We share your information (whether in return for compensation or otherwise) 
            with various vendors, suppliers, and advertisers who wish to do business, or 
            attempt to do business, with you. While we use good faith efforts to verify that 
            such vendors, suppliers, and advertisers promote products and services of interest 
            to site users, we cannot, and do not, endorse such vendors, suppliers, advertisers, 
            products or services unless we expressly state otherwise. </li>
            <li>If you wish us to refrain from providing your personally identifiable information 
            in this manner, please see the opt-out information and contact information 
            provided below. Please note that we will continue to keep your information to the 
            extent that it is necessary to maintain our relationship with you and that an opt-out 
            sent to us after we have passed on your information to a third party will not affect 
            use by that third party of your information. </li>
            <li>Without limiting any other right that we reserve in our terms of use or this privacy 
            policy, you give to us and to those to whom we provide your information the 
            right to contact you and to attempt to sell to you one or more motor vehicles. 
            This includes, without limitation, packaging your information and providing it, 
            for consideration or otherwise, to persons who purchase and/or repurchase your 
            packaged information as a sales lead. You grant your permission for us to do this 
            (and to do all other things reasonably necessary to accomplish this purpose) and 
            for one or more recipients of the information to try to sell you a motor vehicle. 
            The uses of your information are not limited to sales of motor vehicles. Please see 
            our privacy policy for more details.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <h4>CAN-SPAM, Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Similar Law</h4>
    <p>Your use of a this web site establishes a business or other applicable relationship with us for
    purposes of CAN-SPAM, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and all other applicable law
    that addresses unsolicited commercial communications. By accessing, or continuing to access, 
    this Web Site, you agree that we or our agents or persons to whom we provide your information may 
    communicate with you via telephone call, including telephone calls that may use an auto-dialer system, 
    pre-recorded voice, or SMS text message even if your phone number is included in a state, national, 
    or federal do not call list, or otherwise communicate with you regarding promotion of the sale, lease, 
    or exchange of goods, services, real property, or any other thing of value.</p>
    <p>Cookies</p>
        <ul>
            <li>STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL may set and access STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL cookies on your computer.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>A few important things you should know about cookies are that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies.</li>
        <li>We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.</li>
        <li>Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from 
        your hard drive at the end of a session. </li>
        <li>You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so 
        may interfere with your use of the Site.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Confidentiality and Security</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe
        reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or
        services to you or in order to do their jobs. </li>
        <li>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information 
        about you. </li>
        <li>Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as 
        an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical 
        security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and 
        disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or 
        access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse 
        your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work 
        very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that 
        your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>
    <p>Users who no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional materials or have their
    information provided to third parties may opt to not receive such communications or have
    information shared by contacting us using the information below. We will comply with such
    requests as soon as is commercially practicable. Such compliance may involve batch processing
    and other processes that take 30 days or longer. If you opt not to receive such communications or
    allow us to share your information and then give your personal information to us again using a
    site or under other circumstances that permit us to use your information, we will regard your opt-
    out as rescinded.</p>
    <p>In most cases, it is impractical for use to stop any other party to whom we have supplied your
    information from continuing to use the information and opting out will usually not stop others to 
    whom we have provided your information from continuing to use it. </p>
    <p>To opt-out from future communications from us, go to the following web site: </p>
    <p><a href="javascript:void(0)">Unsubscribe Here</a></p>
    <p>Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

    changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email
    address specified in your STANDARD AUTO FINANCIAL account or by placing a notice on
    our site</p>
